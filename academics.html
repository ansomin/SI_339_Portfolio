            <p>Here is a list of courses I enjoyed taking offered at University of Michigan!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="courses" id="eecs183">
            <h2>EECS 183</h2>
            <p>EECS 183 is is an introductory course to computer science and programming. Students will learn the basics of computing, as well as problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. Languages include C++ and Python. 
                EECS 183 was the first computer science class that I took here at University of Michigan. 183 was the class that helped me start my coding journey. Learning takes repetition, and approaching the topic from different angles. 
                EECS 183 provides the repetition and the different approaches through multiple tools, such as ZyBooks and CodeLabs, integrated into the course.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="courses" id="eecs203">
            <h2>EECS 203</h2>
            <p>Introduction to the mathematical foundations of computer science. Topics covered include: propositional and predicate logic, set theory, function and relations, growth of functions and asymptotic notation, introduction to algorithms, elementary combinatorics and graph theory and discrete probability theory. 
                EECS 203 was one of the hardest class I've taken here at University of Michigan. Although the class was difficult, I was able to learn build my mathematical foundation necessary for computer science.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="courses" id="eecs280">
            <h2>EECS 280</h2>
            <p>
                Techniques and algorithm development and effective programming, top-down analysis, structured programming, testing, and program correctness. Program language syntax and static and runtime semantics. Scope, procedure instantiation, recursion, abstract data types, and parameter passing methods. Structured data types, pointers, linked data structures, stacks, queues, arrays, records, and trees. 
                EECS 280 built upon the programming skills I have acquired from EECS 183.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="courses" id="eecs281">
            <h2>EECS 281</h2>
            <p>Introduction to algorithm analysis and O-notation; Fundamental data structures including lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, hash tables, binary trees, search trees, balanced trees and graphs; searching and sorting algorithms; recursive algorithms; basic graph algorithms; introduction to greedy algorithms and divide and conquer strategy. Several programming assignments. 
                EECS 281 was especially enjoyable as all the projects were done from scratch. I enjoyed the freedom of writing my own solution for a given problem set.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="courses" id="si206">
            <h2>SI 206</h2>
            <p>Students develop their core programming and software development skills, to build competency and literacy in important areas that includes basic data structures, debugging and testing, using distributed code repositories, pattern matching, and programmatic gathering and processing of data. Applications in assignments and labs are oriented around data manipulation. 
                SI 206 was my first programming class using Python. I was able to learn how to use useful skills, such as regular expression and API usage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="courses" id="si 339">
            <h2>SI 339</h2>
            <p>This course provides a hands-on approach to learning responsive, accessible front-end programming for Web Design. Topics covered include HTML5, CSS3 (including Bootstrap framework), JavaScript, and the POUR design principles of accessible design. 
                SI 339 was the where I first learned how to code HTML and CSS. Best class here at umich :)
